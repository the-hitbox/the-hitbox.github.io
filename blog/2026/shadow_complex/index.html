<h1 id="game-review-shadow-complex-remastered">Game Review: Shadow Complex Remastered</h1>

<ul class="post-metadata">
	<li><time datetime="2026-02-08">08 February 2026</time></li>
	<li><a href="/tags/game-review/" class="post-tag">Game Review</a></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Released in 2009 to critical acclaim, does Shadow Complex still hold up today?</em></p>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>In a gaming landscape where the &quot;indie metroidvania&quot; reigns supreme, <em>Shadow Complex</em> is a title that isn't really talked about too much. I find this surprising, as the game is often credited as being the catalyst for this surge of metroidvania titles that has continued to dominate the market. <em>Shadow Complex</em> did the whole &quot;indie metroidvania&quot; thing before it was cool, during a period before <em>Hollow Knight</em> made it mainstream and the actual <em>Metroid</em> franchise had seriously lost its way. As a result, I have a lot of respect and admiration for ChAIR Entertainment for developing a legitimate and proper metroidvania during this time. It's clear that a lot of reviewers at the time did too, as <em>Shadow Complex</em> received high-praise upon release, but was that praise justified? Having played the game <strong>decades</strong> after its initial release, I can't help but compare my experiences with <em>Shadow Complex</em> to that of the more recent metroidvanias that have preceded it. When you start looking at it from that lens, the cracks in <em>Shadow Complex</em> start to show. I want to take some time to share my thoughts on said &quot;cracks&quot; and give my views on <em>Shadow Complex</em> as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p><em>Shadow Complex</em> is a 2.5D metroidvania shooter. Most of its combat is pretty satisfying, especially in the end-game where you have more creative freedom in how you want to take enemies down. While the boss fights can be pretty repetitive and bland, the regular combat encounters have enough enemy variety and strategy involved to make them engaging and fun.</p>
<p>There's a noticeable amount of jank:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jason can be difficult to control and will sometimes just ignore your inputs.</li>
<li>Sometimes guns have trouble shooting people in the background.</li>
<li>Sometimes enemies will get stuck in walls.</li>
<li>Often the wrong sound effects will play when you go underwater.</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is less excusable given that I technically played the remastered version of the game, but I never encountered anything game-breaking, so it didn't affect my experience too much.</p>
<p>What the game does really well is how it paces the steady flow of powerups. All the powerups you receive feel important <em>(which is good)</em> and the game does a good job at giving you these powerups at a slow-enough pace. Jason's evolution from some guy with a gun to an unstoppable killing machine feels natural <em>(which is also good)</em>.</p>
<h3 id="map-design">Map Design</h3>
<p><em>Shadow Complex</em>'s map is... surprisingly linear. For most of the game, you're put on a fairly linear track where you do a loop through the entire map; there's very little backtracking and the way forward is typically pretty clear. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the map opens up significantly near the end and there's still a lot of secrets and extra powerups you can find by exploring. Regardless, it does lead to a different style of map design that I think is worth commenting on.</p>
<p><em>Shadow Complex</em>'s linear map design allows for certain rooms to have focused environmental puzzles, that aren't common in other metroidvanias where the world is more open. You interact a lot with the environment, which definitely helps the game stand out. The downside of this becomes more obvious in the endgame. Because progression routes are so structured, revisiting areas to search for missed upgrades often means replaying puzzles you've already solved <em>(those elevator puzzles in particular can be insanely tedious)</em>.</p>
<p>It's a difficult line Shadow Complex tries to walk, balancing classic metroidvania openness with more controlled, linear progression. There isn't an obvious solution that would allow the game to fully achieve the strengths of both approaches, but the tension between them exposes real friction in how the world is laid out.</p>
<h3 id="atmosphere">Atmosphere</h3>
<p>I've always believed atmosphere is essential to a good metroidvania. When progression depends entirely on a player's willingness to explore, it's up to the developer to create an environment worth exploring. This isn't a hot take (players and developers recognize this today) but it's worth reiterating that <em>Shadow Complex</em> released before metroidvanias became mainstream. The &quot;metroidvania design playbook&quot; wasn't yet widely understood. As a result, it's understandable yet unfortunate that <em>Shadow Complex</em> fails in this category. Save a few areas, most of the game's map consists of same-y grey, metallic corridors. Even worse, there's absolutely no music in any of these areas; <strong>just pure, absolute silence.</strong> None of these areas have any unique atmosphere at all, which is a shame.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the prison on the far-right edge of the map. Upon arriving here for the first time, you're greeted by a giant row of jail cells and run into Mr. Sweet, a super creepy <em>(inexplicably German)</em> interrogator, whose preferred method of interrogation is dissecting his victims while they watch <em>(yikes!)</em>. This is meant to be a creepy area, where you first become truly aware of The Restoration's sinister goals. Man... don't you just wish they developed any sort of atmosphere to help develop that? Many areas in <em>Shadow Complex</em> are like this, and it's really unfortunate.</p>
<h2 id="story">Story</h2>
<p><em>Shadow Complex</em>'s story revolves around Jason Flemming. Jason is a regular everyman who goes on a hike in the middle of the woods with Claire, a woman he just met at a bar the previous night <em>(kind-of a weird first date... but sure)</em>. While exploring, they come across a massive <em>not-so-secret</em> military complex run by a revolutionary group known as <strong>The Restoration</strong>, a terrorist group hellbent on &quot;liberating&quot; the United States <em>(their exact philosophy is not really established outside of some ramblings about Imperial Rome)</em>. Soldiers kidnap Claire, and so Jason decides to pick-up a gun and murder everyone. Boom, that's all there really is to it.</p>
<p>ChAIR contracted award winning comic book writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_David">Peter David</a> to be the primary writer for the game, which is pretty awesome! The comic book influence he brings is pretty apparent in almost every aspect of the game: the goofy dialogue, the boss fights, even the art-style leans away from classic realism for a more stylized, high-contrast look. This all really helps <em>Shadow Complex</em> develop its own unique identity that helps it stand out in a very oversaturated &quot;military shooter game&quot; market.</p>
<p>Outside of that though, the story isn't anything great. Director Donald Mustard said he wanted the game to emulate the minimalist narrative approach of <em>Super Metroid</em>, while it's clear that Peter David's story tries to go for a more goofy action movie narrative. The game tries to do both, adhering to the narrative structure of <em>Super Metroid</em> while trying to recreate the tone and style of something like <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, which unfortunately does not work. The minimalist structure doesn't allow for these action movie characters to strongly define themselves or develop in any meaningful way <em>(there's actually a prologue where you play as some guy named Sam. I didn't mention it because he contributes absolutely nothing to the story)</em>.</p>
<p>The issues with the story don't detract too much from the game. Not every game has to have some incredible narrative, and <em>Shadow Complex</em> does a decent enough job at contextualizing why you're going around killing everyone in this base, which is really all it needed to do. Regardless, it would've been a lot nicer if this story gave a bit more time to its plot and characters.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Shadow Complex</em> is a legitimately fun yet flawed game. While its heart seems to be in the right place, most of its issues are hard to ignore. I can't help but feel like ChAIR perhaps took on more than they could handle with this project, as most of the issues seem to stem from a lack of clear vision and poor direction. This claim is strengthened considering ChAIR's lack of notable titles after <em>Shadow Complex</em> <em>(they made a couple iOS games that are no longer available...).</em></p>
<p>I admire <em>Shadow Complex</em> as an important artifact in indie-game history, and it does enough right to be a worthwhile pickup if you ever come across it. It doesn't seem like ChAIR is really around anymore, but I do wish them the best. It'd be interesting to see them return to the <em>Shadow Complex</em> franchise at some point, now that proper metroidvania design is a more universal concept.</p>
<p><strong>RATING: 7/10</strong></p>
