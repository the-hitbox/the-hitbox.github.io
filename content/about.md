# About

Hi! My name is Declan Scott. I'm a Computer Science student at the [University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu).
Hitbox is my website where I write about my experiences as a amateur game developer as well as various reviews for 
games I feel I have a lot to say about. Please subscribe to my RSS feed if you enjoy my posts! I've been using [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) as my news reader of choice for a while, and honestly it's great!

### More on Game Development

I've been using Unity for years, and I *feel* as though I've gotten pretty decent with it over that time. I have yet to make any AAA GOTY smash hits *(keyword here is 'yet')*, but I've participated in a lot of game jams and I'm quite proud of some of the resulting projects. Everything I've made so far is on my [itch.io page](https://datoneguy246.itch.io/). 

It's been a goal of mine to develop a larger game worthy of being sold commercially, and I hope to document that on here someday.
